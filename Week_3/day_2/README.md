# First lab Practice
# Bash Arithmetic Operations

This simple Bash script demonstrates basic arithmetic operations in a user-friendly way. It prompts you to input your name, two numbers, and then calculates and displays the sum, difference, and product of these numbers.

## Usage

1. Save the script in a file, e.g., `arithmetic_operations.sh`.
2. Make the script executable: `chmod +x arithmetic_operations.sh`.
3. Run the script: `./arithmetic_operations.sh`.

Follow the on-screen prompts and input your name, first number, and second number. The script will then perform arithmetic operations and display the results.

## Prerequisites

- A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, etc.) with Bash installed.

## Script Explanation

1. The script begins by asking you to input your name using the `read` command.

2. It then prompts you to enter the first and second numbers.

3. The script performs the following arithmetic operations on the two numbers:
   - Sum: `num1 + num2`
   - Difference: `num1 - num2`
   - Product: `num1 * num2`

4. Finally, it displays your name, the two input numbers, and the results of the arithmetic operations.
