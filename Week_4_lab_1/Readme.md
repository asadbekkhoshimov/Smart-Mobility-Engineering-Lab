# Academic README - ROS 2 Turtlesim and RQT Tutorial

## Introduction

This repository encapsulates my academic exploration of the ROS 2 Turtlesim and RQT tutorial. As a student and novice in the field of Robotics, this tutorial served as an invaluable pedagogical resource for understanding the core principles of ROS 2, covering nodes, topics, services, and remapping.

## Tutorial Overview

### Background

In the realm of robotics and automation, Turtlesim represents a minimalist simulator. This tutorial leverages Turtlesim to elucidate fundamental ROS 2 concepts, shedding light on the orchestration and interaction mechanisms within the ROS ecosystem. Further, we explore the ROS 2 tool, which facilitates system management and introspection, and RQT, a graphical user interface for ROS 2 that streamlines manipulation of ROS 2 components.

### Prerequisites

To ensure a seamless learning experience, I meticulously followed the guidance provided in the "Configuring Environment" tutorial, prepping my environment with requisite dependencies.

### Task 1: Installing Turtlesim

Sourcing setup files and the installation of the Turtlesim package for ROS 2 were the inaugural steps in my journey.

### Task 2: Initiating Turtlesim

Upon installation, launching the Turtlesim simulator welcomed me with a visually delightful environment, featuring a central turtle. The accompanying terminal messages, such as turtle names and spawn coordinates, augmented my understanding.

### Task 3: Turtlesim Interaction

In a separate terminal, I initiated a node responsible for controlling the turtle within the Turtlesim environment. Using keyboard inputs, the turtle embarked on its voyage, sketching a trail of its path, simulating real-world robot interactions.

### Task 4: Installing RQT

As I progressed, I extended my toolkit by installing RQT and its pertinent plugins, transforming my learning journey into a more user-centric and GUI-driven experience.

### Task 5: Leveraging RQT

Venturing into RQT, I delved into its Service Caller plugin, which facilitated interactions with Turtlesim. I demonstrated my newfound capabilities by creating a new turtle and even altering the pen color of the default turtle.

### Task 6: Node Remapping

The tutorial culminated with a lesson in remapping. I discovered the means to control multiple turtles independently by remapping the cmd_vel topic, a quintessential skill for those contemplating scenarios with multiple robotic entities.
